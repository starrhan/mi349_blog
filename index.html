       <h3>Birthday Weekend</h3>

       <p>
           This weekend was my birthday. I turned 22 years old. To celebrate, my friends and I went to Barrio for some margaritas and tacos. My friend Brendan came to visit me. <br>
            Brendan goes to school in Toledo, Ohio and studies pharmacy. My roommates attended as well. My roommate's names are Kendyl, Kaelan, and Sarah. My neighbors across the<br>
             hall joined as well. Their names are Dom and DeAri. The next day, we went to the zoo. Originally, we were going to go to the Detroit Zoo but it was too far so we went<br>
              to the Potter Park Zoo in Lansing. My favorite animal to see was the baby rhino. I also enjoyed seeing the two bald eagles up close. Sadly, the reptile museum was <br>
              closed. After that, we got ice cream for an afternoon snack. My friends Connor and Chris came over and we baked a cake together. All of my friends played card games <br>
              together. My dad dropped off some cider and donuts for us. He surprised me with a box of corona beers and limes. It was very funny, given the current situation and<br>
               that I can't go out and drink at a bar. I had a great birthday.<br>

       <h3>Knee Surgery</h3>
       <address class="author"><a rel="author" href= "https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannahcstarr/">Hannah Starr</a></address>
       <time datetime="2020-10-12" title="October 12, 2020">Oct 12, 2020</time>
       <p>Next week, I am getting surgery on my knee. Unfortunately, I tore my ACL and meniscus and sprained my MCL. My MCL will be able to recover without any surgical intervention. <br>
           I was playing soccer with a group of my friends and collided with someone and twisted my knee. I went to the hospital that night and got x-rays. This happened a month ago. <br>
           Because of problems finding a caretaker that provides my insurance, it took over a month to get me scheduled for surgery. Next Thursday, I have to go to the hospital in the <br>
            afternoon and they will put me under and I will be able to go home that night. My sister tore her ACL this spring so she also just had the same surgery on the same knee so <br>
            I can use her brace to help me recover for the next six months. I am not nervous for the surgery, I am mainly just annoyed that I will have to sit in bed for six weeks without <br>
            being able to sleep on my side or really move my leg at all. At least this accident happened while all my classes are online. I think everything will be fine. <br>
